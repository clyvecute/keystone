# Tools

Keystone includes custom-built tools to enhance operational workflows.

## Preflight Checker

**Location:** `tools/preflight/`

**Purpose:** Validates environment readiness before deployment

**Language:** Go

**Why Go?**
- Fast compilation to single binary
- No runtime dependencies
- Cross-platform (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- Type-safe validation logic
- Demonstrates Go proficiency

### Features

- Checks gcloud CLI installation and authentication
- Verifies Terraform version compatibility
- Validates GCP project configuration
- Confirms required APIs are enabled
- Checks state bucket existence
- Validates Terraform formatting
- JSON output for CI/CD integration
- Clear pass/fail with actionable messages

### Usage

```bash
# Build
make build-preflight

# Run
make preflight

# Or directly
./bin/preflight

# With JSON output
PREFLIGHT_JSON=true ./bin/preflight
```

### Integration

**Makefile:**
```makefile
preflight: build-preflight
	@./bin/preflight
```

**GitHub Actions:**
```yaml
- name: Preflight Check
  run: make preflight
```

**Pre-deployment:**
```bash
make preflight && make apply ENV=prod
```

### Why This Matters

**For Recruiters:**
- Demonstrates Go proficiency
- Shows operational thinking
- Proves automation skills
- Real-world utility, not a toy

**For Operations:**
- Catches issues before deployment
- Saves time debugging
- Standardizes environment checks
- Integrates with CI/CD

**For Teams:**
- Onboarding tool for new developers
- Prevents common mistakes
- Documents requirements as code
- Self-documenting checks

## Future Tools (Planned)

### Config Validator
- Validates Terraform variables
- Checks for security misconfigurations
- Ensures cost controls are in place

### Drift Detector
- Detects infrastructure drift
- Compares actual vs. desired state
- Generates drift reports

### Cost Estimator
- Estimates deployment costs
- Compares cost across environments
- Alerts on cost increases
